# Game-side knowledge (decomp / emu64 / data)

- Game code: `src/` (decomp, gnu89 C, relies on UB — see the CMake UB-guard
  flags; treat as vendored, edit only for real bugs, keep upstream-diffable).
  **On Dreamcast `src/` is never edited at all** — compat fixes go in
  `dc/include/dc_prelude.h` (`CLAUDE.md` §1).
- **What the decomp's UB actually is, measured (2026-08-06).** This was
  folklore until `make warnscan` recompiled all 3,926 TUs at `-O2` with the
  decomp's `-w` removed (132 s) and `tools/dcopt/warnscan_report.py` reduced
  the 64,729 warnings to the classes an optimizer can act on: **35 missing
  returns in 30 files, 99 uninitialised reads, 8 array-bounds, 3
  sequence-point, 0 strict-aliasing.** Two things matter for anyone reasoning
  about this code:
  - **`emu64.c` — the hot file, and one of the four `.c` files compiled as
    C++ — is CLEAN on missing returns.** That is the important one: in C++ a
    missing return is UB that G++ turns into `__builtin_unreachable` and
    deletes outright, whereas in ordinary C the caller merely gets garbage.
  - **`jammain_2.c` is the one C++-compiled TU that is not clean** — C++ *and*
    a missing return *and* 22 uninitialised reads, the most in the tree. It is
    not quarantined because at `DC_AUDIO=0` it never ticks; it is the first
    file to suspect the day audio work starts.
  `DC_AUTOVAR_INIT=zero` A/Bs the 99 uninitialised reads. Detail:
  `kb/state-log.md` 2026-08-06.
- ⚠️ **The "decomp code cannot be optimized" rule is gone (2026-08-06).**
  `src/` builds at `-Os` with an 18-TU `-O3` hot list on Dreamcast
  (`dc/opt-lists.mk`); `.text` 5,506,964 → 2,753,700, town FPS 11.6 → 20.6.
  The UB above is real, but it is handled with guard flags (`OPT_GUARDS`) and
  a per-TU quarantine list, not with `-O0`.
- **emu64** (`src/static/libforest/emu64/`): the game's own N64→GC graphics
  emulation layer — AC is an N64 game running on a GC shim. It emits GX
  calls; our pc_gx layer sits below it. It omits GXEnd (why
  `pc_gx_flush_if_begin_complete` exists) and reuses memory buffers for
  different textures/TLUTs (why the texture cache hashes contents).
  Known past fix: `mw_data` → `moveword->data` (emu64.c:5537, armhf build).
- **32-bit assumption everywhere**: JSystem/decomp casts pointers to u32.
  Everything must build ILP32 (armhf ok; arm64 branch upstream used other
  tricks). Never store pointers in u32 in new code paths without checking.
- Supported image: GAFE01 USA Rev 0 only. Assets read directly from the iso
  at runtime (pc_disc.c/pc_dvd.c, synchronous fread — SD card reads are a
  possible minor stutter source on first area loads).
- Saves: GCI format in `save/`, Dolphin-compatible both directions.
- Texture packs: Dolphin format (XXHash64 names, DDS) in `texture_pack/`;
  `preload_textures` setting: 0 off, 1 preload at boot, 2 preload+cache file.
  Perf cost on device — off by default.
- Settings quirks: `fps_target=6` = dynamic (enum in pc_settings.h);
  `window_size` is a preset index (5=custom); overlay menu (Select button)
  tabs: VIDEO/AUDIO/CTRL/DEBUG/PERF — menu item↔tab mapping in
  pc_overlay.c `menu_item_tab[]`.
- Model viewer debug mode: `--model-viewer [index]`.
- Built-in NES emulator: NOT implemented on PC — `ac_my_room.c:2111`
  `#ifdef TARGET_PC` stubs all famicom furniture to the "no software"
  message (kb/issues.md 2026-07-19). `pc_gx_restore_after_nes()`
  (pc_gx.c:522) is uncalled scaffolding; if an NES core is ever wired in
  with its own GL objects, call it after the emu runs — it rebinds ours
  and dirties all state, and any new global GL state must be handled
  there too.
- **Campsite villagers cannot move in — by design** (verified in source
  2026-07-19 after a player report of talking/playing games for an hour
  with no move-in offer): the camper is special NPC type 0xD05E
  (m_npc.h:24 — 0xD000 event NPCs, vs 0xE0xx regular villagers); move-in
  runs through the grow system (`mNpc_SetGrowNpc` m_npc.c:4382 sets
  `moved_in` only for regular types; grow_list.c eligibility table covers
  the 236 regular NPCs only) and the contract talk trigger
  (ac_npc_talk.c_inc:446) never fires for special types. No pc/ override
  touches any of this. Same as the original GC game — campers
  (tent/igloo) are minigame/item visitors only; camper move-in is a
  New Leaf-era mechanic. Not village-rating, not RNG bad luck. Save
  editors are the only route, and see kb/issues.md — unvalidated edited
  saves currently crash the port.
- `--time HOUR` overrides in-game hour; handy for testing time-of-day
  rendering (fog/lighting TEV configs differ by hour → different shaders).

## Reading the game's own dialogue (2026-07-29, issue #6)

Fastest way to settle "what does this message actually say / what does it do":
dump the text bank and read the entry. Message numbers in code (`MSG_2350`,
`aNRST` `msg_table[] = {0x30CD, ...}`) are **entry indices** into it.

```bash
# 1. pull forest_2nd.arc out of the iso (GC FST: u32 fst_offset/size at 0x424,
#    12-byte entries, flag/name-offset/data-offset/size, names in the string
#    table after the entries) — a ~20-line python FST reader does it
# 2. python3 tools/arc_tool.py forest_2nd.arc outdir     # RARC unpack
# 3. python3 tools/msg_tool.py -m unpack \
#      outdir/bin2/data/message_data.bin messages.txt    # finds *_table.bin itself
```

Output is `[[ENTRY n START]]` blocks with control codes decoded, e.g.
`<<BTN>>` (wait for A), `<<MSGEND>>`, `<<OPENCHOICE>>`, `<<SETNEXTMSGn>>`,
and `<<DEMONPC0 [idx hi lo]>>` — that last one is what drives NPC talk state
machines: it sets `mDemo_Set_OrderValue(mDemo_ORDER_NPC0, idx, val)` from
`mMsg_Main_Cursol_SetDemoOrder_ControlCursol` (m_msg_cursol.c_inc:124), and
actor procs idle until `mDemo_Get_OrderValue(..., 9) != 0`. So a dialogue that
appears stuck is usually an actor waiting on an order code the script has not
reached — or, as in issue #6, a message that only *reads* like it's working.
`string_data.bin`/`select_data.bin` etc. unpack the same way (see
`aram_resName[]`, jsyswrap.cpp:373).

## In-game save flow (who actually writes the GCI)

Door gyroid (`ac_haniwa*`, "haniwa" = gyroid) only *offers* the save:
`aHNW_ACTION_SAVE_CHECK` → `SAVE_END_WAIT` → `PL_APPROACH_DOOR` → player walks
in the door → `SCENE_PLAYERSELECT_SAVE` (m_scene.c:354) → restart NPC
(`ac_npc_restart_talk.c_inc:191`, the "Are you done playing?" animal) →
`mCD_SaveHome_bg` (pc/src/pc_m_card.c:989) → `pc_save_write_gci_ex`.
`param_1` there is 1 for save-and-continue (gyroid/door), 0 for the final
save-and-quit — it decides whether Resetti's reset code stays armed.
Gyroid refuses entirely during the intro; see kb/issues.md.
The only silent path through the writer is `!pc_save_ready` (returns TRUE
without writing), so "log.txt mentions no save at all" means the save scene
was never reached, not that a write failed.

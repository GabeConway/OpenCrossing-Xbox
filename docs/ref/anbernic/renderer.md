# Renderer architecture (GX → GLES translation layer)

All in `pc/src/` + `pc/include/pc_gx_internal.h`. The game's decompiled code
calls the GameCube GX API; these files implement it on GL/GLES.

## Pipeline overview

- `pc_gx.c` — GX state machine (`g_gx` global `PCGXState`), vertex
  submission (GXBegin/GXPosition*/GXEnd), draw dispatch
  (`pc_gx_flush_vertices`), dirty-flag uniform upload, framebuffer copies.
- `pc_gx_tev.c` — TEV combiner → fragment shader. Generates a small
  **branchless GLSL shader per unique TEV config** (~30-50 configs in AC)
  instead of an uber-shader; Mali hates dynamic branching. 256-slot in-memory
  cache keyed by 72-byte `ShaderKey`.
- `pc_gx_texture.c` — GC texture format decoders (I4/I8/IA4/IA8/RGB565/
  RGB5A3/RGBA8/CI4/CI8/CMPR, tiled → linear RGBA8) + 2048-entry texture cache.
- `pc_gx_mtx.c`, `pc_vi.c` (frame pacing/swap/dynamic fps), `pc_overlay.c`
  (bitmap-font FPS counter + settings menu + boot splash).

## Batching & draw dispatch

- Vertices accumulate in `g_gx.vertex_buffer` (64k cap, 48-byte PCGXVertex).
- emu64 usually omits GXEnd; `pc_gx_flush_if_begin_complete()` flushes when
  the declared vertex count arrives. **Every GX state setter calls it first**,
  so state changes always flush the open batch before mutating state.
- **Draw-call merging (2026-07-13)**: `GXBegin` appends to the still-open
  previous batch when it completed with `dirty == 0` (nothing ran in between),
  same primitive (QUADS/TRIANGLES only) and same vtxfmt. Strips/fans never
  merge (would bridge geometry). See GXBegin in pc_gx.c.
- **State-set dedup (2026-07-13)**: setters early-return on no-op re-sets
  (compare before flush/DIRTY) so merging spans them — `pc_gx_state_dedup`,
  env PC_NO_STATE_DEDUP=1 disables. Rules when touching setters: any setter
  that makes a GL call (viewport/scissor/GXLoadTexObj) must flush BEFORE its
  first GL call and may only skip when the GL-side state is provably
  identical (viewport/scissor shadow computed GL values, invalidated in
  begin_frame/restore_after_nes; GXLoadTexObj compares g_gx.gl_textures[map]
  + sampler state). Pure-state setters just compare their g_gx fields.
- Quads draw via a static quad→triangle index buffer (GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY);
  everything else via glDrawArrays. One VAO/VBO bound forever.
- **Streaming VBO (2026-07-13, v2)**: 6MB buffer (PC_GX_STREAM_VERTS=128k),
  batches append at a running offset, orphan only on wrap. Upload via
  glMapBufferRange(WRITE|INVALIDATE_RANGE|UNSYNCHRONIZED) with SubData
  fallback (PC_STREAM_SUBDATA=1 forces it). Draws use
  glDrawElementsBaseVertex / glDrawArrays(first) so attrib pointers are
  NEVER respecified on GLES3.2 drivers; pre-3.2 falls back to
  `pc_gx_set_attrib_base` rebasing. First 2000 flushes poll glGetError
  and auto-drop to the legacy per-flush-orphan path (with log line) on
  any error. WARNING: v1 (SubData + per-batch attrib respec) rendered
  fine on Mesa but SILENTLY black-screened the Mali blob — do not
  reintroduce per-draw glVertexAttribPointer churn. Anything adding draw
  paths must pass draw_base through the same mechanism.
  PC_NO_STREAM_VBO=1 forces legacy. Device-verified but throughput-
  neutral (~30µs/draw is blob dispatch overhead) — reduce draw count
  instead (kb/perf.md #13).

## Shader system details

- Uniforms uploaded per dirty group (PC_GX_DIRTY_* bits). **Uniform value
  shadowing (2026-07-13)**: shader switch does NOT set dirty=ALL — uniform
  groups (bits 0-11) carry generation counters bumped on change
  (`pc_gx_mark_dirty`); each program records last-uploaded gens (tev cache
  entry `gens[]`, exposed via `pc_gx_tev_last_gens`), flush uploads only
  mismatches. GL-state groups (bits 12-15) stay on `g_gx.dirty`. Anything
  touching GL outside the GX layer must call `pc_gx_dirty_all()` (bumps all
  gens), not just set dirty=ALL. TEXTURES+TEV_STAGES upload/record as one
  block. Env PC_NO_UNIFORM_SHADOW=1 disables.
- **Per-program uniform locations**: `PCGXUniformLocs` filled once at link
  (`pc_gx_fill_uniform_locations` in pc_gx.c), stored in the shader cache
  entry; `pc_gx_tev_last_locs` exposes the last-returned program's locs and
  pc_gx.c struct-copies it on switch. Never call glGetUniformLocation per
  switch (~150 calls — was a real cost).
- **Shader binary disk cache** (`shader_cache.bin`, cwd; GLES builds only,
  `SHADER_DISK_CACHE` define): header magic `ACSC` + version + driver hash
  (FNV of GL_RENDERER+GL_VERSION — driver update invalidates). Entries:
  ShaderKey + binfmt + len + blob, appended on each new compile
  (`sdc_append`), all preloaded at boot (`sdc_load`) via glProgramBinary.
  `GL_PROGRAM_BINARY_RETRIEVABLE_HINT` set before link. Env
  `PC_NO_SHADER_CACHE=1` disables. Fallback uber-shader kept for
  compile-failure path (its locs in `s_fallback_locs`).
- Changing generated shader source or ShaderKey layout? **Bump SDC_VERSION**
  so stale caches self-invalidate.

## Texture system details

- Cache key: data_ptr + w/h + format + TLUT identity + content hashes
  (FNV of head+tail bytes — game reuses buffers with different contents).
- **4096-slot open-addressed hash index** over the entry array (2026-07-13);
  bulk-only deletion: eviction (oldest half, memmove) rebuilds the index,
  invalidate clears it. Never delete single entries without handling index.
- **Per-frame decode budget**: max 8 non-tiny (>32x32) CPU decodes per frame
  on the miss path; over budget → shared 1x1 white placeholder bound, entry
  NOT cached, retried next frame. Texture-pack and EFB-capture paths exempt.
- **NEON decode paths** (`__ARM_NEON` guarded) for the hot formats + u32
  palette writes; scalar fallbacks kept for other archs and edge blocks.
  Output must stay byte-identical to scalar.
- EFB captures (GXCopyTex) stay GPU-side: blit into a texture via FBO
  (`pc_gx_efb_capture_*`), no glReadPixels round trip (PC_ENHANCEMENTS).

## Frame flow

`VIWaitForRetrace` (pc_vi.c): poll events → (frameskip fast path) → blit
render-FBO to screen → overlay → swap → dynamic-fps EMA update →
frame pacing wait → begin next frame. Render-scale renders into
`s_render_fbo` at reduced res, upscaled at blit. `fps_target=6` in
settings.ini means **dynamic**, not 6 fps.

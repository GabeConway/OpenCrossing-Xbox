# Performance knowledge & playbook

## Current state (2026-07-13, post-P4, v0.3.0)

Device log (P4 build, 183 gameplay PERF samples): **avg 56.4 fps, median
59.3, 78% of samples ≥55** (v0.2.0: avg 52.4, 63% ≥55, dips to 30).
Worst sustained dips now 41-44 fps during heaviest acre streaming; user
reports "~20 fps faster on average" feel. Speed avg 98.4%. Zero crashes,
zero GL errors. **GL is no longer the bottleneck**: gl avg 5.4ms (was
9.1), draws avg 114.6 (was 271), and ALL 75 gameplay stutters are
work-dominated (median 24ms, max 114ms; zero gl-dominated). Remaining
levers are game-side: per-TU -O2 on loader/decompression TUs, iso
read-ahead, CPU pre-transform (see #14 findings).

## Fixed so far (chronological, 2026-07-13)

1. ~150 glGetUniformLocation per shader switch → per-program `PCGXUniformLocs`
   cache (struct copy on switch).
2. Texture cache linear scan (up to 2048 entries per GXLoadTexObj, hundreds
   of calls/frame) → open-addressed hash index.
3. Mid-frame Mali shader compiles on first visit to each area → shader binary
   disk cache preloaded at boot. First-ever visit per TEV config still
   compiles once; all later runs are hitch-free. Verified: 2nd boot preloads
   from `shader_cache.bin`.
4. **Game code built at -O0**: CMAKE_C(XX)_FLAGS_RELEASE overrides in
   pc/CMakeLists.txt carried no -O flag; only pc/ platform sources had
   per-target -O2. Fixed with -O2 in RELEASE flags + `-mcpu=cortex-a53
   -mfpu=neon-vfpv4` in build-armhf-docker.sh (Debian armhf gcc defaults to
   vfpv3-d16 → no NEON, no vectorization) + -O3 for pc_gx_texture.c.
5. New-area texture decode burst → NEON decoders + per-frame decode budget
   (8/frame, placeholder + retry). Trades hitch for 1-2 frames of pop-in.
6. Per-draw driver overhead → GXBegin batch merging (quads/triangles with
   unchanged state concatenate into one draw call). Kill switch:
   PC_NO_DRAW_MERGE=1. GXSetViewport/GXSetScissor flush the open batch
   (they apply GL state immediately — required for merge correctness).
   Device data 2026-07-13: still 491-600 draws/frame in town, gl=15-26ms —
   per-draw overhead is the current #1 bottleneck (see kb/issues.md).
8. emu64.c + emu64_utility.c at -O2 (per-TU, with gnu89 + UB guards):
   device-verified safe (train intro passes, crashes=0), home area
   36 → 35-40 fps. Template for optimizing further decomp TUs one at a
   time; next candidates: decompression/loader TUs behind the 8.7s menu
   stall, m_field/actor update paths.
7. First-launch shader compiles (music stutter in menus, hitches) →
   **seed warmup**: pc/shaders/shader_seed.bin ships driver-independent
   ShaderKeys (43 configs harvested from a device playthrough; blobs
   stripped); pc_gx_tev_init compiles all of them during the LOADING splash
   and persists driver binaries. Regenerate seed: copy a well-traveled
   shader_cache.bin and strip blobs (see kb/build-test.md).

## -O2 regression (IMPORTANT)

-O2 on decomp game code: wild-pointer crash loop on device from frame 1
(log: "CRASH #N in game frame ... addr=0xDC08093A", black screen with
music). -O1: hard SIGBUS on the intro train scene. Game code is therefore
pinned at **no -O** in CMAKE_C(XX)_FLAGS_RELEASE; pc/ platform sources keep
per-source -O2/-O3. Do not raise game-code optimization without device-
testing a full new-game intro (KK Slider → train → town arrival).
SIGBUS is now caught by the crash-recovery handler (pc_main.c) and stdout
is line-buffered, so future device logs show the crash context.

9. **GX state-set dedup** (2026-07-13, DEVICE-VERIFIED same day: smoother,
   better 1% lows, acre loads clean, ~30 fps avg walking during acre loads;
   no visual regressions reported): decomp re-sets
   identical GX state constantly; every set flushed the open batch, which is
   why 500+ draws survived merging. All hot setters (TEV, blend/depth/cull,
   lighting, texgen, matrices, viewport/scissor, GXLoadTexObj) now compare
   against current state and early-return on no-ops — no flush, no dirty, so
   GXBegin merging spans them. Viewport/scissor shadow the *computed GL*
   values (invalidated in pc_gx_begin_frame + restore_after_nes since
   overlay/begin_frame touch GL viewport directly). GXLoadTexObj does the
   pure-CPU cache lookup before any flush and no-ops when the map already
   holds the same GL texture + sampler state; texture-cache invalidate clears
   g_gx.gl_textures so freed/reissued GL ids can't fool the check.
   Kill switch: PC_NO_STATE_DEDUP=1.
   **Device log numbers (2026-07-13 SD mount, P1 build)**: avg 271
   draws/frame (max 665; was 491-600), avg gl=9.1ms (max 26; was 15-26),
   avg 52.4 fps with 63% of samples ≥55 fps, avg speed 99%, 0 crashes,
   0 audio underruns. P1 roughly halved draw count and gl time.

10. **Per-program uniform value shadowing** (2026-07-13, P2,
    DEVICE-VERIFIED same day: "slightly better", worst case now ~30 fps
    during fast acre-grid walking — shipped in v0.2.0. v0.2.0 log
    re-measure: per-draw slope UNCHANGED at 29.5µs/draw (was 29.3) —
    uniform re-uploads were not the per-draw bottleneck; the cost is in
    glBufferData orphan + draw dispatch itself, i.e. P3 territory. P2
    kept: correct, zero overhead, and it removes work that would
    otherwise scale with future shader-switch-heavy content): shader switch no longer sets dirty=ALL (was re-uploading every
    uniform group ~each switch, and switches happen constantly at 500+
    draws/frame). Every real state change bumps a per-group generation
    counter (`pc_gx_mark_dirty`, bits 0-11 = uniform groups); each program
    (tev cache entry + fallback) records the generation it last uploaded per
    group; flush uploads only mismatched groups and records them. GL-state
    groups (depth/colormask/cull/blend, bits 12-15) stay on plain g_gx.dirty
    — they're global GL state, not per-program. Gens bumped for ALL groups
    only when GL touched outside GX layer (`pc_gx_dirty_all`: init,
    restore_after_nes; NES clobbers texture-unit bindings, which ride the
    TEXTURES group). Eviction path in tev cache_insert resets the slot's gen
    record. Kill switch: PC_NO_UNIFORM_SHADOW=1 (restores dirty=ALL on
    switch). Two correctness fixes shipped with it: (a) pc_gx_begin_frame
    forces depth/color masks for glClear — now DIRTYs DEPTH|COLOR_MASK so a
    deduped same-value re-set can't leave the forced masks active; (b)
    frameskip flush no longer clears g_gx.dirty (it applied nothing to GL, so
    clearing dropped GL-state changes made during skipped frames).

12. **Seed regrown 43 → 101 configs** (2026-07-13, from a device
    shader_cache.bin after a longer playthrough incl. interiors): the P1
    session log showed 24 mid-session "[PC/TEV] Compiled specialized shader"
    hitches (each a mid-frame Mali compile; the worst gl-dominated stutters,
    e.g. gl=344ms at 31 draws, line up with these). Old 43-key seed is a
    strict subset. Deployed to SD same day. Regrow again whenever logs show
    mid-session compiles. v0.2.0 log: 1 compile all session (was 24), max
    gameplay stutter 124ms (was 545ms) — verified.

11. **Dynamic-fps upward probe** (2026-07-13, P2.5, DEVICE-VERIFIED same
    day; v0.2.0 log confirms: every sub-35fps run sits at 487-578 draws
    with gl 18-19ms = genuine load; zero lock signatures (no low-fps runs
    in light scenes) — shipped in v0.2.0):
    governor was bistable — low target ⇒ more logic ticks per measured
    batch ⇒ measured work stays high ⇒ low target self-sustains (device:
    outdoor 30 fps until a house visit reset it to 60). When target < 60,
    every 120 render frames the EMA halves to re-test headroom; genuine
    load re-converges in ~4 frames. Kill switch PC_NO_FPS_PROBE=1.

13. **Streaming VBO (P3)** (2026-07-13): per-flush `glBufferData`
    orphan+upload replaced by one 6MB VBO (128k verts), batches append at
    a running offset, orphan only on wrap. Targets the measured
    29.5µs/draw dispatch cost (kb/issues.md).
    **v1 BLACK-SCREENED on device** (game alive, overlay drew, scene
    black, no logged errors; rendered fine under Mesa) — glBufferSubData
    + per-batch attrib-pointer respec upsets the Mali blob silently.
    **v2 (5886c75, awaiting device test)** uses the Mali happy path:
    glMapBufferRange(WRITE|INVALIDATE_RANGE|UNSYNCHRONIZED) upload,
    glDrawElementsBaseVertex/glDrawArrays(first) so attribs are never
    respecified (pre-3.2 fallback: rebase), and a 2000-flush glGetError
    probe that logs + auto-drops to the legacy path on any error. Boot
    log prints "[PC/GX] streaming VBO on (upload=..., base_vertex=...)".
    Switches: PC_NO_STREAM_VBO=1 legacy path, PC_STREAM_SUBDATA=1 forces
    SubData upload for on-device A/B. Screenshot harness for Mesa visual
    checks: Xvfb -fbdir XWD dump, see scratchpad shot.sh pattern (worth
    porting into harness/ if needed again).
    **v2 DEVICE-VERIFIED 2026-07-13**: renders correctly, zero GL errors,
    no fallback, user reports grids feel smoother. BUT throughput-neutral
    on early data: per-draw slope ~30.3µs (n=46, was 29.5), heavy scenes
    still ~35 fps. Per-draw cost is therefore raw draw-dispatch overhead
    in the Mali blob, not buffer management. Kept for the smoothness
    (map path avoids driver sync stalls → better 1% lows). CONCLUSION:
    the next real lever is REDUCING DRAW COUNT, not cheapening draws —
    top idea: convert strips/fans to indexed triangles at accumulation
    time so they become mergeable with triangle batches (strips/fans
    never merge today, see GXBegin merging rules).

14. **P4: strip/fan→triangle conversion + whole-batch CPU cull + batch
    diagnostics** (2026-07-13, DEVICE-VERIFIED same day, shipped v0.3.0;
    smoke 2x PASS, Mesa screenshot A/B clean — geometry/winding correct).
    **Device results**: avg 56.4 fps / median 59.3 / 78% ≥55 (was 52.4 /
    63%); draws avg 114.6 med 109 (was 271); gl avg 5.4ms (was 9.1);
    0 crashes, 0 GL errors, no visual regressions reported.
    **The cull is the win**: avg 286, median 386, max 532 batches culled
    per frame — 60-80% of submitted batches are fully offscreen (the game
    submits whole acres; the frustum holds a fraction). Worst dips now
    41-44 fps at ~500 submitted batches (cull scan + game work, not GL).
    **merged=0 across the whole session**: GXBegin merging never fires on
    device — ~90% of surviving batches have a state change in between
    (breaks: mv=41%, tex=30%, begin=19%, light=4%). Conversion's merge
    payoff is therefore unrealized until matrix loads stop breaking
    batches (CPU pre-transform idea); its current value is uniform prim
    stream + cullable strip geometry.
    **Slope metric caveat**: gl accumulator now includes the cull scan of
    culled batches, so µs/draw (~44) is NOT comparable to pre-P4 (29.5).
    Compare total gl ms instead.
    (a) GXBegin converts TRIANGLESTRIP/TRIANGLEFAN to independent triangle
    lists at vertex accumulation (winding-preserving, fan pivots on v0) so
    they merge like triangle batches — strips/fans never merged before.
    Kill switch PC_NO_STRIP_CONVERT=1. Completion tracked on SOURCE vertex
    count (s_conv_src_*), expected_vertex_count now counts EMITTED verts.
    (b) Whole-batch CPU frustum cull at flush: object-space AABB, 8 corners
    through exact shader transform (clip = P*MV*pos), homogeneous
    half-space test (all 8 corners outside same plane ⇒ skip). Culled
    batches skip draw + ALL uniform upload, dirty stays set (frameskip
    pattern). Kill switch PC_NO_BATCH_CULL=1. Qemu smoke intro scene:
    culled 139-159 vs drawn 147-200 per frame (~45% of batches).
    (c) PERF line extended: per-prim draw counts (q/t/s/f/o), merged=,
    culled=, and batch-break attribution (breaks: begin/vp/mv/tex/tevc/
    tevs/light/oth) — first dirty-group set after a real flush claims it.
    Smoke data: mv (matrix loads) dominates breaks (206-241/frame, ~70%)
    ⇒ next lever after this: CPU pre-transform of positions at accumulation
    so matrix changes stop breaking batches (then merging spans objects).

## Runtime triage switches (launcher env vars)

- PC_NO_BATCH_CULL=1 — disable whole-batch CPU frustum cull (P4)
- PC_NO_STREAM_VBO=1 — disable streaming VBO (per-flush orphan fallback)
- PC_STREAM_SUBDATA=1 — streaming VBO uploads via glBufferSubData not map
- PC_NO_FPS_PROBE=1 — disable dynamic-fps upward probe
- PC_NO_UNIFORM_SHADOW=1 — disable per-program uniform value shadowing
- PC_NO_STATE_DEDUP=1 — disable no-op GX state-set dedup (batch-merge enabler)
- PC_NO_DRAW_MERGE=1 — disable GXBegin draw-call merging
- PC_NO_NEON_DECODE=1 — scalar texture decoders
- PC_NO_DECODE_BUDGET=1 — decode every texture the frame it's requested
- PC_NO_SHADER_CACHE=1 — disable shader binary disk cache + seed warmup

## Measuring

- Draw count + fps live in window title / FPS overlay ("N draws").
- verbose=1 → `[PERF]` every 60 frames and `[STUTTER]` lines for frames >1.5x
  average, with breakdown: `work` (game logic+GL calls), `swap`, `gl`
  (accumulated flush time), `tex` (accumulated texture decode+upload time),
  `draws`.
- `[PROF]` slow-phase profiler (pc/src/pc_prof.c, added 2026-07-14 to hunt
  the one-time 1.4s dock hang): logs `[PROF] tag(0xID): X.XXXms` for any
  probed phase over PC_PROF_MS ms (env var, default 50). Probes: game_main /
  sAdo_frame (graph.c), play_move / play_draw / submenu_ctrl / demo_main /
  ev_run / dmacopy_bank / submenu_move / coll_oc / call_actor / msg_main /
  camera_proc / business / trc_move (m_play.c), field_move / born_item /
  actor_ct / actor_mv / actor_dw with actor profile id (m_actor.c),
  dvd_read with length (pc_dvd.c), os_report = stdout/SD write stall
  (pc_os.c), card_write (pc_card.c). Always on; overhead is two
  clock_gettime per probe below threshold. Attribute a [STUTTER] by the
  [PROF] lines adjacent to it in the log.
- Attribute dips: high `tex` → decode burst; high `gl` → uniform/draw
  overhead; high `work` others low → game logic (check -O flags first);
  `swap` high → GPU-bound (lower render scale).

## Remaining ideas (unimplemented)

- Decode-ahead: warm texture cache during acre-transition wipe (needs a hook
  into game-side room transition; fragile).
- Worker-thread texture decode (memcpy source at enqueue; GL upload stays on
  main thread). Superseded partially by the budget.
- LTO (`-flto`): untested; long link under qemu, try locally first.
- Uniform buffer objects for TEV state — probably not worth it at current
  uniform counts.
- Second render thread: no — game is deeply single-threaded.

## Perf-relevant settings (all runtime-toggleable in overlay menu)

`fps_target` (6=dynamic), `render_scale`, `frustum_cull` (+margin/max
distance), `shadow_quality`, `reduce_acre_draw`, `particle_quality`.

## Gotchas

- Never add per-draw glGetUniformLocation / glGetError (PC_GL_CHECK is
  compiled out unless PC_GL_DEBUG).
- Frameskip path (`g_pc_frameskip_active`) must skip ALL GL work but still
  clear buffers logically — check both paths when touching flush/begin_frame.
- Mali: prefer fewer, larger draws; avoid mid-frame shader compiles; avoid
  glReadPixels (use FBO blits).
